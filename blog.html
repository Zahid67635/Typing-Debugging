        <h1>Q-1) What is the Difference between global and local scope?</h1>
        <p>
            Ans:<br>
            scope of a variable is the region of your program in which it is defined. JavaScript variables have only
            two scopes.

            Global Variables − A global variable has a global scope which means it can be defined anywhere in your
            JavaScript code.

            Local Variables − A local variable will be visible only within a function where it is defined. Function
            parameters are always local to that function.</p>

        <h1>Q-2) What is the Difference between local storage and session storage?</h1>
        <p>
            Ans: <br>
            Local Storage: <br>
            The storage capacity of local storage is 5MB/10MB.As it is not session-based, it must be deleted via
            javascript or manually. The client can only read local storage. <br> <br>
            Session Stoarage: <br>
            The storage capacity of session storage is 5MB. It’s session-based and works per window or tab. This
            means that data is stored only for the duration of a session, i.e., until the browser (or tab) is
            closed. The client can only read local storage. <br> <br>

        <h1>Q-3)How does javaScript event loop work?</h1>
        <p>Ans:<br>The Event Loop has one simple job — to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call
            Stack is
            empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which
            effectively runs it.

            Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop. Each event is just a function callback</p>

        <h1>Q-4)How many ways we can get undefined?</h1>
        <p>
            Ans: <br>
            8 ways to get Undefine <br>
            1. variable that is not initialized will give undefined<br>
            2. function with no return<br>
            3. parameter that is not passed will be undefined<br>
            4. if return has nothing on the right side will return undefined<br>
            5. property that doesn't exists on an object will give you undefined<br>
            6. accessing array elements outside of the index range<br>
            7. deleting an element inside an array<br>
            8. set a value directly to undefined<br><br>
